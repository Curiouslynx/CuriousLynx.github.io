there is a problem with triggering the events when the dataset is empty. if there is no data to be rendered, the events are not triggered. it is not dependant on the onload function, but rather the data of the series; which is a big inconevience.
there is also another problem with mouse-events; they ONLY WORK if users click on series, but not on the chart itself.
